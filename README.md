# My-Bio
Professional Resume 
I am an eager and aspiring individual looking to secure my first job as a data analyst. I have a passion for solving business problems related to process improvements and efficiency gains.

I am currently studying on the LSE Career Accelerator course for Data Analytics and am really enjoying utilising new skills and tools such as Tableau and SQL. My next course involves learning Python and I am hoping within the next few months to be very comfortable with using these tools. 

I have a passion for Triathlon and currently compete in Half Ironman Races. Last year, I competed in my first Half Ironman and came 5th in my age group with a time of 5hrs. I am hoping to buy a new TT bike and look towards some more races next summer
