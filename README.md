# My-Bio
Professional Resume 
I am an eager and aspiring individual looking to secure my first job as a data analyst. I have a passion for solving business problems related to process improvements and efficiency gains.

I am currently studying on the LSE Career Accelerator course for Data Analytics and am really enjoying utilising new skills and tools such as Tableau and SQL. My next course involves learning Python and I am hoping within the next few months to be very comfortable with using these tools.
